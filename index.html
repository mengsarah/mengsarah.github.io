            <p>I aim to be a developer who makes lives better by sharing knowledge with no reservations so that everyone can benefit.</p>
            
            <p>I'm trying to make this site friendly for mobile users and users with larger text sizes.</p>
            
            <p>This site is responsive!</p>
            
            <p>Progress is slow, partly because I'm indecisive about how I want my site to look and partly because I'm trying to figure out at least basic accessibility. My current audience probably won't include users who will benefit from explicit accessibility efforts, but I want to start now so that in the future, I'm already primed for accessibility development.</p>
            
            <p>I'm also making this website from scratch.</p>
